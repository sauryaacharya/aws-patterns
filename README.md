# ðŸ§© AWS Serverless Patterns & Examples

This repository demonstrates common AWS serverless architecture patterns using Terraform and sample code. Each folder contains a self-contained example you can deploy and test locally using the AWS CLI and Terraform.

The goal is to make it easy to learn, build, and reuse proven event-driven architecture patterns on AWS.
